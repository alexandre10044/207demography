# 207demography
Epitech Project, MATHS 207

Subject:

The world population growth is a cause for concern for most people: 1 billion people in 1800, 2 billion peo-ple in 1927, 6 billion people in 2000 and more than 7.5 billion people today. . . Predicting future populationusing past censuses is therefore a key concept.

Along with this subject, you will find a file named207demography_data.csv, which gives an estimation ofevery countryâ€™s population from 1960 onwards. If world population growth seems exponential in the long-term, in a shorter term it seems linear: using this data, you must establish the linear least squares regressionthat will allow you to predict population depending on the year.

In the following,Yis the population (in million people) andXthe year. With one or several country codesas inputs, your program will print:
  1. theaXandbXcoefficients of the linear fitY=aXX+bX,
  2. the root-mean-square deviation of this fit,
  3. the population prediction in 2050 according to this fit,
  4. theaYandbYcoefficients of the linear fitX=aYY+bY,
  5. the root-mean-square deviation of this fit,
  6. the population prediction in 2050, according to this fit,
  7. the correlation coefficient betweenXandY.
